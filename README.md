It is built using pandas, numpy, scikit-learn and xgboost libraries.    

The data was taken from the Kaggle database [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/house-prices-advanced-regression-techniques/data)  


### Goal of this project

The goal of the project is to go through the entire cycle of a machine learning project from data collection to creating a program ready to predict house prices using the new data.
